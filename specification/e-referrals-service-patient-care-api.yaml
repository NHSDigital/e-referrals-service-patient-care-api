    ## Overview
    
    Use this API to retrieve referrals for a patient from the [[HYPERLINK_ERS]] and, if applicable, retrieve service information for a referral that has a current appointment booking with a service or is currently deferred to a service.
  
    This API is designed to be used by the [[HYPERLINK_PC_AGGREGATOR]].
    
    As an integrated system acting on behalf of a patient, you can:
    
      - retrieve a patient's referrals
      - retrieve information for a single service
    
    You cannot use this API to:
      - get patient personal demographic details â€“ instead, use the [[HYPERLINK_PDS]]
    
    You can access the following data:
      - a summary of each active or cancelled referral
          
    ### Access modes
    
    This API has one access mode:
    
    | Access mode                   | Authentication via         | Functions               | Availability                    |
    | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | [[HYPERLINK_PATIENT_ACCESS]]  | [[HYPERLINK_NHS_LOGIN]]    | Get own details         | [[HYPERLINK_IN_PROD_BETA]]      |
  
    #### Patient, user-restricted access
    This access mode allows integrated systems acting on behalf of a patient to access Patient Care FHIR API endpoints by authenticating users with [[HYPERLINK_NHS_LOGIN]].
  
    ## Who can use this API
    
    Currently, this API is for [[HYPERLINK_INTERNAL_USE_ONLY]].
    
    ## Related APIs
    
    The following APIs are related to this API:
    
      - [[HYPERLINK_ERS_FHIR_API]] - use this API to access the national service for creating and managing paperless referrals in primary and secondary care.
      - [[HYPERLINK_PDS]] - use this API to access patients' personal information such as name, address, date of birth, related people, registered GP and NHS number.
      - [[HYPERLINK_PC_AGGREGATOR]] - use this API to get an aggregated list of referrals and bookings for a patient from secondary care providers.
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    
    This API is [[HYPERLINK_IN_PROD_BETA_INTERNAL]].
    
    ## Service level
    This API is a gold service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.
    
    For more details, see [[HYPERLINK_SERVICE_LEVELS]].
    
    ## Technology
    
    This API is [[HYPERLINK_RESTFUL]].
    
    It conforms to the [[HYPERLINK_FHIR]] global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [[HYPERLINK_FHIR_R4]], except that it does not support the [[HYPERLINK_CAPABILITIES]] interaction.
    
    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [[HYPERLINK_FHIR_UK_CORE]], specifically [[HYPERLINK_FHIR_UK_CORE_STU1]].
    
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    
      - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/ServiceRequest` not `/servicerequests`
      - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
      - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    
    There are [[HYPERLINK_LIBRARIES_AND_SDKS]] available to help with the FHIR API integration.
    
    ## Network access
    
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [[HYPERLINK_HSCN]].
    
    For more details see [[HYPERLINK_NETWORK_ACCESS]].
    
    
    ## Security and authorisation
        
    This access mode is [[HYPERLINK_USER_RESTRICTED]].
    
    The end user must be:
    - present
    - a patient
    - strongly authenticated and authorised by [[HYPERLINK_NHS_LOGIN]]
    
    To use this access mode, use one of the following security patterns:
    - [[HYPERLINK_USER_RESTRICTED_SEPARATE_AUTHENTICATION]]
    - [[HYPERLINK_USER_RESTRICTED_COMBINED_AUTHENTICATION]]

    ## Onboarding
    
    Currently new suppliers are not being onboarded onto this API.

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

      summary: Retrieve referral requests for a patient
      description: |
        ## Overview
        
        Use this endpoint to retrieve e-RS referrals for an authenticated patient, including summary details relating to its current state. This includes Appointment Requests in a variety of states including Booked, Unbooked, and Cancelled.
        
        Where the referral is currently being managed by a service provider, this endpoint will reference the Service ID for that service. This can then be used to retrieve the service information using [[HYPERLINK_A002]].

        The active referrals that are returned by this endpoint are the same referrals that are accessible to the patient via [[HYPERLINK_MANAGE_REFERRAL]].

        ## Pre-requisites
        
        In order to use this endpoint the patient must be an authenticated user.
        
        The patient needs to have authenticated via [[HYPERLINK_NHS_LOGIN]] and meet the required [[HYPERLINK_PROOFING_LEVEL]] (currently this is "P9").

        I want to retrieve my referrals
        
        So that I can view and manage my referrals
        
        ## Related endpoints
        
        You can retrieve the attributes of a single service via [[HYPERLINK_A002]] using the Service ID
